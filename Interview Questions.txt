Spoke to Arpit, he actually joined another org last week. He was very keen on EXL but due to the delay, he joined elsewhere.
He is still open for a call with EXL & wants to understand if this is going to be an interview again or just a normal chat. Since he has newly joined he can only spend 30mins on this call.
He got a base of 120K CAD in this new org
