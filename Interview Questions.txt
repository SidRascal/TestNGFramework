He is still open for a call with EXL & wants to understand if this is going to be an interview again or just a normal chat. Since he has newly joined he can only spend 30mins on this call.

Call was good
nothing technical, just basics
but it was a managerial discussion, around client facing etc
He was good, & this was another person. not from the last time.

He also asked abt Architect level questions, he knows how things are done but he doesn't have hands on exp in Architecturel side. he has worked as an Engineer.

Hey P, spoke to Arpit last night.

The call was fine.
Nothing technical, just the basics.
but it was a managerial discussion, around client-facing, Architecting, etc
He felt they needed strong Architectural experience, and he has understanding but not in-depth knowledge of designing & Architecting. His core experience is in Data Engineering.
So, he wasn't sure if he was the right guy for this role. Wanted to know their feedback.
Earlier all the rounds were hardcore technical & everything was related to his experience only.

The leadership team is 

As P mentioned - The business has slowed down at Persistent, it was going good until last month

 some restructuring going on within the Leadership team So all the roles are back in the approval stage, they are scrapping many roles as well. So he doesn't want to waste our time on working.

For most of the roles Approvals are pending
Initially they all were approved, but there is some restructuring going on within the Leadership team So all the roles are back in the approval stage, they are scrapping many roles as well. So he doesn't want to waste our time on working.

For now, he has asked us to focus on replacement roles until he gets clarity on the approvals for other roles.
Pharma role - its a bit challenging, but now they have opened a few more locations to get candidates from. So Will try to share more CVs here.
